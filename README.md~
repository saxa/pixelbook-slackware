Stuff specific to slackware OS for the Google Pixelbook Eve

In this repository you will find my slackbuilds and scripts for Slackware OS I used to get my Google's Pixelbook EVE model configured.


* GRUB

To make grub appear in a way that is readable we have to add/uncomment the following 
lines in the /etc/default/grub file.

In the line below put the 2400x1600 resolution. To check the supported resolutions
you can press c in grub and issue the vbeinfo.

GRUB_GFXMODE=2400x1600,auto 

Then uncomment the line below:

GRUB_FONT=/usr/share/grub/dejavusansmono.pf2

And rebuild grub.cfg with grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg .
