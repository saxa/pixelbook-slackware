Alsa UCM files for Google's Pixelbook
=====================================

This configuration files were creaded by Jason Montleon 
and you can get them from his github account at:

This SlackBuild was created to facilitate the install
and maybe modify it according to how Slackware uses it.

I believe that we do not need this scripts in ALSA ucm directory
as in my case the standard install had a nearly perfectly working
sound.

Maybe I decide to incorporate later also some other rules 
into this package like automate of swithicing the output 
when headphones are plugged in, which right now does not 
work our of the box.
