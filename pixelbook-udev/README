Udevd rules and hwdb files for Google's Pixelbook
=================================================

This configuration files were creaded by Jason Montleon 
and you can get them from his github account at:

https://github.com/jmontleon/pixelbook-fedora

This SlackBuild was created to facilitate the install
and maybe modify it according to how Slackware uses it.

Maybe we later we add other and more of them if needed
at all.
